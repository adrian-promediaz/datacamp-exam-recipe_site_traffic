# Datacamp Exam Recipe Site Traffic

This repository contains the projects to tackle the challenge in [Data Scientist certification requirement](https://app.datacamp.com/certification/get-started/data-scientist/overview).

## The focus of the business is on the following objectives:

1. Correctly predict high traffic recipes 80% of the time.
2. Predict which recipes will lead to high traffic.

## Business Metrics (Business KPIs)
The business metrics are as follows:

1. Precision score.

To meet the business goals, we will use the "Precision"* score of our model. Therefore, we aim for a precision greater than 80%. Precision is crucial for predicting high traffic accurately. Therefore, we prioritize ensuring our model is as accurate as possible when predicting high traffic, while being less concerned about predictions for low traffic.

2. Ability predict which recipes will lead to high traffic.

To meet the business goals, we will use a feature importance algorithm to identify which features attract high traffic.
